#     pretrained-vit-pytorch

  This GitHub repository contains a pretrained Vit model that described in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". The paper proposes a Transformer model with an attention mechanism for large-scale image recognition problems. The model was implemented in Python using the PyTorch library.
